This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the detection of abnormalities in MRI scans. The model is trained using a dataset of MRI images with labeled abnormalities, such as tumors, lesions, or other anomalies.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to privacy and copyright restrictions. However, you can use your own dataset or obtain a similar dataset from publicly available sources to train the model.

### Model Architecture
The CNN model used for detecting abnormalities in MRI scans is built using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from the input images and make predictions.

### Training
To train the model, you can use the provided script along with your dataset. It's recommended to use a GPU for faster training and better performance. The training script will output the trained model weights which can be used for inference on new MRI scans.

### Inference
Once the model is trained, you can use it to detect abnormalities in new MRI scans. You can use the provided inference script to load the trained model weights and make predictions on new MRI images.

### Dependencies
- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Usage
1. Prepare your dataset of MRI scans with labeled abnormalities.
2. Train the model using the training script and your dataset.
3. Use the trained model for inference on new MRI scans using the inference script.

### Note
This model is for educational and research purposes only and should not be used for clinical diagnosis. Always consult with a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
